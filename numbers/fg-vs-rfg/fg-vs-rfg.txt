# forgegradle vs retrofuturagradle

i recently updated unimixins to use rfg instead of fg, and immediately noticed
that my ci build times have doubled. i did some profiling on my own machine and
collected the results here.

these were done in freshly cloned repos, but with a warm gradle cache.

(note that unimixins is a special case that heavily uses gradle subprojects;
these results may not apply to the average mod, at least not to this extent.)


## tl;dr

first rfg build takes 9 minutes, uses 2.62 gb of ram and 881 mb of disk space
first fg build takes 1.5 minutes, uses 1.1 gb of ram and 72 mb of disk space

incremental builds are comparable, they take ~30s with both. rfg may be slightly
faster here.

final disk space usage is 958 mb for fg and 339 mb for fg
